## Step 4: Get Your Public Key
1. Go to "Account" in your EmailJS dashboard
2. Find your "Public Key" (also called User ID)
3. **Copy this key** - you'll need it in the next step

## Step 5: Update Your Website Code
Replace the placeholder values in your `script.js` file:

1. **Line 3**: Replace `"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"` with your actual public key
2. **Line 32**: Replace `"YOUR_SERVICE_ID"` with your service ID
3. **Line 32**: Replace `"YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID"` with your template ID

**Example:**
```javascript
// Replace this line:
emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
// With something like:
emailjs.init("user_abc123xyz789");

// Replace this line:
emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', templateParams)
// With something like:
emailjs.send('service_abc123', 'template_xyz789', templateParams)
```

## Step 6: Test Your Form
1. Upload your updated website
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Submit it
4. Check your email inbox for the registration details

## Free Tier Limits
- **200 emails per month** (plenty for most use cases)
- **50 KB per email**
- **50 requests per hour**

## Troubleshooting
- **Form not sending?** Check browser console for errors
- **Not receiving emails?** Check your spam folder
- **Getting 403 errors?** Make sure your public key is correct
- **Template not working?** Verify template ID and variable names match

## Security Note
Your EmailJS public key will be visible in your website's source code. This is normal and safe - EmailJS public keys are designed to be public. You can restrict which domains can use your service in the EmailJS dashboard under "Settings" â†’ "Security".

## Next Steps
Once everything is working, you might want to:
1. Set up email autoresponders for parents
2. Create a backup email address to receive submissions
3. Set up webhooks for additional integrations

Your AI Camp registration form is now fully functional with EmailJS! ðŸŽ‰
