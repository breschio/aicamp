4. **Important:** In the email template settings, set the "To Email" field to: `{{to_email}}`
5. Save the template

## Step 4: Get Your Public Key
1. Go to "Account" in your EmailJS dashboard
2. Find your "Public Key" (also called User ID)
3. **Copy this key** - you'll need it in the next step

## Step 5: Update Your Website Code
Replace the placeholder values in your `script.js` file:

1. **Line 3**: Replace `"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"` with your actual public key
2. **Line 32**: Replace `"YOUR_SERVICE_ID"` with your service ID (same for both emails)
3. **Line 32**: Replace `"YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID"` with your notification template ID
4. **Line 42**: Replace `"YOUR_CONFIRMATION_TEMPLATE_ID"` with your confirmation template ID

**Example:**
```javascript
// Replace this line:
emailjs.init("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
// With something like:
emailjs.init("user_abc123xyz789");

// Replace these lines:
emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID', templateParams)
// and
return emailjs.send('YOUR_SERVICE_ID', 'YOUR_CONFIRMATION_TEMPLATE_ID', parentTemplateParams);

// With something like:
emailjs.send('service_abc123', 'template_xyz789', templateParams)
// and
return emailjs.send('service_abc123', 'template_confirm456', parentTemplateParams);
```

## Step 6: Test Your Form
1. Upload your updated website
2. Fill out the registration form with a real email address
3. Submit it
4. Check both:
   - **Your registration email** (where you'll receive the detailed notification)
   - **The parent's email** (they'll receive a confirmation)
